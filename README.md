# DSP-audio-steganography
 In this repository we have code for audio on audio steganography. Here we are hiding secret message into main cover audio. 
# All operations are done in time domain. 
As I wasn't able to file find audio on audio steganography online so I did it myself. 
I haven't tested limitations of this code please do check and tell me.
# Instructions
first open cmd or terminal and run
"pip install librosa"\n
"pip install scipy"\n
"pip install numpy"\n
 "cover.wav" & "msg.wav" are sample audios provided my me for testing. Keep your audio files in the same directory as the code and run the program and follow along the instructions.
